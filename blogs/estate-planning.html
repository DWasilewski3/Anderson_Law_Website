            <p>Most people hear the words Estate Planning and think that it is for only high income or net worth individuals. The reality is that Estate Planning is for everyone and everyone does it. The only difference is the the ones that do it right, get the results they intend.</p>
            <p>A lot of people "plan" by doing nothing. This is actually a form of estate planning, but it's not a very effective one. When you don't have proper estate planning documents in place, you're essentially letting the state decide what happens to your assets and who takes care of your children.</p>
            <p>Proper estate planning includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wills:</strong> Specify who gets your property and who cares for your children</li>
                <li><strong>Trusts:</strong> Provide ongoing management of assets and tax benefits</li>
                <li><strong>Power of Attorney:</strong> Designate someone to handle your financial affairs</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare Directives:</strong> Specify your medical wishes and designate decision-makers</li>
                <li><strong>Guardianship Designations:</strong> Choose who will care for your minor children</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without these documents, your family may face:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Probate court proceedings that are expensive and time-consuming</li>
                <li>Uncertainty about who will care for your children</li>
                <li>Potential disputes among family members</li>
                <li>Unnecessary taxes and expenses</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Estate planning isn't just about wealth—it's about ensuring your wishes are carried out and your loved ones are protected. Everyone, regardless of income level, should have basic estate planning documents in place.</p>
