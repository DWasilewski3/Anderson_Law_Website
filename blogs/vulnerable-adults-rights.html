            <h2>Vulnerable Residents Are Owed Protection</h2>
            <p>Mom is in an assisted living facility to help her with her dementia and is a "vulnerable person" under the law (MCL 400.11(f).) Late one night, the staff in the home finds another resident in her room attempting to engage in sex with mom.</p>
            <p>This scenario highlights a critical issue in elder care and disability rights. Vulnerable adults, particularly those with cognitive impairments, are entitled to protection under Michigan law. The Vulnerable Adult Protection Act provides specific protections for individuals who are unable to protect themselves from abuse, neglect, or exploitation.</p>
            <p>Key protections under the law include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Right to be free from physical, emotional, and sexual abuse</li>
                <li>Right to proper medical care and treatment</li>
                <li>Right to be treated with dignity and respect</li>
                <li>Right to have their basic needs met</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When these rights are violated, families have legal recourse. The facility has a duty to protect vulnerable residents and can be held accountable for failing to do so. This includes implementing proper security measures, adequate staffing, and appropriate supervision.</p>
            <p>If you have a loved one in a care facility who has experienced abuse or neglect, it's crucial to document everything and seek legal counsel immediately. The law provides specific remedies for violations of vulnerable adult rights.</p>
